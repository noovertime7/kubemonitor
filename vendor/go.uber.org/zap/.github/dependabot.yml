  # Since Zap is a library, we don't want to update its dependency requirements
  # regularly--not until we need a newer version of a dependency for a feature
  # or specific fix.
  # This way, users of Zap aren't forced to upgrade all their transitive
  # dependencies every time they upgrade Zap.
  #
  # However, we do want to regularly update dependencies used inside the tools
  # submodule because that holds linters and other development tools.
