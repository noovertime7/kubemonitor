Generating schemas
==================

This folder contains a few schemas, which are generally generated by
using `k8s.io/kube-openapi/cmd/openapi2smd`.

For example, to generate the `k8s-schema.yaml` file, the following
command can be used:

```
$ go run k8s.io/kube-openapi/cmd/openapi2smd@latest < \
  <(curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json) \
  >k8s-schema.yaml
```
